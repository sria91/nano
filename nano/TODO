TODO file (? means the feature may be implemented, but not definitely)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

For version 1.4:
- UTF-8 support. [DONE except for edit window text wrapping and the
  NO_CONVERT flag, which should allow editing UTF-8 as raw bytes.]
- Support for paragraph searches. [DONE]
- Support for justifying the entire file at once. [DONE]
- Support for filename searches in the file browser.
- Undo/Redo key?
- Rebindable keys?
- Keystroke to implement "Add next sequence as raw" like vi's ^V. [DONE]
- Spell check selected text only. [DONE]
- Make "To Line" (^W^T) and "Read from Command" (^R^X) reenter their
  parent menu when their keystroke is entered a second time (^W^T^T and
  (^R^X^X) (requires figuring out when to keep cursor position and when
  not to). [DONE]

- Rewrite the nano FAQ in SGML.

Old requests:
