INSTRUCTIONS TO COMPILE AND INSTALL NANO CVS VERSIONS
-----------------------------------------------------

GNU nano is available from CVS, but building this needs a bit more care
than the official stable and unstable tarballs.

To successfully compile GNU nano from CVS, you'll need the following
packages:

- autoconf (version >= 2.54)
- automake (version >= 1.7)
- gettext (version >= 0.11.5)
- texinfo
- cvs
- glib 2.x (if your system doesn't have snprintf() and/or vsnprintf())
- make, gcc and the normal development libraries (ncurses, etc.)

These should be available on your GNU mirror.

To download the CVS tree, execute the following command:
$ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/nano login
and press enter at the password prompt.
Then, do
$ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/nano checkout nano
and the nano tree will download.
If you want to checkout the stable CVS branch, append -r nano_1_0_branch:
$ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/nano checkout -r nano_1_0_branch nano

Once you have the sources in the "nano" directory, cd into it, and
execute the "autogen.sh" script in the top directory.  This will set up
a configure script and Makefile.in, and you will be ready to compile
with
$ ./configure [--add-options-here] && make
Once it's done compiling,
$ make install
(as root) should put the required files in their respective directories.

Please submit any bugs in the CVS branch to nano-devel@gnu.org.
