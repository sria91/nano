INSTRUCTIONS TO COMPILE AND INSTALL NANO CVS VERSIONS
-----------------------------------------------------

GNU nano is available from CVS, but building this needs a bit
more care than the official stable and unstable tarballs.

To succesfully compile GNU nano from CVS, you'll need the
following packages:

- autoconf (versions 2.13 or >= 2.50)
- automake (version 1.4-pl5 recommended)
- autoheader
- gettext (version 0.10.40)
- texinfo
- cvs
- make, gcc and the normal development libraries (ncurses, etc)
These should be available on your GNU mirror.


To download the CVS tree, execute the following command:
$ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/nano login
and press enter at the password prompt.
Then, do
$ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/nano checkout nano
and the nano tree will download.
If you want to checkout the stable CVS branch, append -r nano_1_0_branch:
$ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/nano checkout -r nano_1_0_branch nano

One you have the sources in the "nano" directory, cd into it, and execute
the "autogen.sh" script in the top dir. This will setup a configure script
and Makefile.in, and you will be ready to compile with
$ ./configure [--add-options-here] && make
Once it's done compiling,
$ make install
should put the required files in their respective directories.


Please submit any bugs in the CVS branch to nano-devel@lists.sourceforge.net.
[FIXME needs change for Savannah too]
