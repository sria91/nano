.SH NAME
nano \- Nano's ANOther editor, an enhanced free Pico Clone
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B nano
.RI [options]\ [+LINE] " file"
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B nano
command.
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics, 
.\" respectively.
\fBnano\fP was originally known as TIP (TIP Isn't Pico). It is a small,
free and friendly editor which aims to replace Pico, the default editor
included in the non-free Pine package. Rather than just copying Pico's
look and feel, 
.B nano
also implements some missing (or disabled by
default) features in Pico, such as "search and replace" and "goto line
number".
