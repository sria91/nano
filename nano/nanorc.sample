# Don't follow symlinks when writing files
# set nofollow

# Set operating directory (chroot of sorts)
# set operatingdir "~"

# Use Pico Compatibility mode for the shortcut lists and search text
# set pico

# Use this value instead of the default
# set fill -8

# Use this tab size instead of the default
# set tabsize 4

# Use this spelling checker instead of the default one

# Disallow file modification, why would you want this in an rc file? ;)
# set view

# Don't wrap text at all
# set nowrap

# Don't display the help lists at the bottom of the screen

# Allow nano to be suspended with ^Z
# set suspend

# Use smooth scrolling as the default
# set smooth

# Use alternate keypad routines
# set keypad

# Don't convert files from DOS/Mac format

# Allow multiple file buffers (using ^R inserts into separate buffer)
# You must have configured with --enable-multibuffer or --enable-extra for
# this to work
#
# set multibuffer

# Use this as the quoting string.  You shouldn't need to change this,
# but...... default "> "
# set quotestr "// "

#
# Color setup
# Format: 
# syntax "short description" ["filename regex" ...]
# color foreground,background "regex" ["regex"...]
#
# Legal colors are: white, black, red, blue, green, yellow, purple, cyan
# You may use the prefix "bright" to mean a stronger color highlight
#
# To use multi-line regexes use the start="regex" end="regex" format.
#
# If your system supports transparency, not specifying a background
# color will use a transparent color.  If you don't want this, be sure
# to set the background color to black or white.
#
# syntax "c-file" ".*\.c" ".*\.h"
# color red "\<[A-Z_]\{2,\}\>" 
# color green "\<float\>" "\<char\>" "\<int\>" "\<void\>"
# color green "\<static\>" "\<const\>" "\<struct\>" 
# color brightyellow "\<if\>" "\<while\>" "\<do\>" "\<else\>" "\<case\>" "\<switch\>"
# color brightcyan "#define" "#include" "#ifn*def" "#endif" 
# color brightcyan "#elif" "#else" "#if"

# You will in general want your comments and strings to come last, becase
# syntax highlighting rules will be applied in the order they are read in

# color brightyellow "<[^= ]*>" "\"[^"]*\""
# color brightblue "//.*"
# color brightblue start="/\*.*" end="\*/"

# For this you will probably want to set your editor to "nano -Y mutt"
#
# syntax "mutt"
# color green "^>.*"
