2009-02-16 Chris Allegretta <chrisa@asty.org>
	* Add new argument to reset_multis for force redraws without attempting to
	  guess whether we need to, for functions that we don't have good info about
	  the text state.  New utility function color.c:reset_multis_for_id().  

2009-02-15 Chris Allegretta <chrisa@asty.org>
	* configure.ac, doc/man/Makefile.am - Add check for HTML output support in GNU
	  groff.  Fixes Savannah bug #24461: build traps on groff.  Also, add installation
	  of html-ized man pages to $datadir/nano/man-html, since we should probably
	  install files we went to all the trouble of generating.

2009-02-14 Chris Allegretta <chrisa@asty.org>
        * nano.c (precalc_multicolorinfo) - Add debugging so we have a better clue if further
          issues arise.   Also start at the beginning of later lines when trying to match the
          end of a multi-line regex.  Fixes more overly aggressive highlighting found by 
          Mike Frysinger.  Finally, advance to the match end for performance.

2009-02-11 Chris Allegretta <chrisa@asty.org>
	* nanorc.c (parse_include): Do call real_dir_from_tilde() on included
	  files in .nanorc, but still avoiding bug #25297.  Fixes ~ and ~user
	  specifications for nanorc include files, as reported by Eitan Adler.

2009-02-09 Chris Allegretta <chrisa@asty.org>
	* New option -q, --quiet, rcfile option "quiet" implemented.  Skips printing
	  errors about the rcfile and asking user to press enter.  Also, nano should
	  now only ask for one enter press when there is an error when not using -q.
	  Based on discussion between Eitan Adler and Mike Frysinger.
	* rcfile.c (parse_keybinding) -  Significant cleanups and fixes for 
	  detecting and reporting errors in key bindings code.

2009-02-08 Chris Allegretta <chrisa@asty.org>
	* Make reset_multidata reset more lines, since contrary to previous problems the
	  syntax highlting is now too *un*ambitious, causing display glitches when
	  deleting a regex boundary.
	* Add more multidata initliazers for new buffers and 'magic lines'.  Fixes segfaults
	  with syntax highlighting in new buffers, initially reported by Mike Frysinger.

GNU nano 2.1.8 - 2009.02.07
2009-02-06 Chris Allegretta <chrisa@asty.org>

	  Savannah bug 25490, nanorc: "include"ing a file which doesn't exist causes nano to segfault.

2009-02-05 Chris Allegretta <chrisa@asty.org>
	* More color syntax speedups:  Determine in reset_multis() whether we really need to call
	  edit_refresh().  Additional global var edit_refresh_needed() to hopefully reduce
	  repeated calls to the function.  New helper funcs reset_multis_before() and 
	  reset_multis_after().

2009-02-02 Chris Allegretta <chrisa@asty.org>
	* New color precalculation code for mult-line regexes.  New function precalc_multicolorinfo(),
	  new structure multidata for keeping track of where regexes start/stop.  More 
	  performance improvements forthcoming.

2009-01-29 Chris Allegretta <chrisa@asty.org>
	* nano.c (move_to_filestruct) - properky initialize new fileage for multiswatching, sigh.
	  Fix cut sefaults discovered by Mike Frysinger.

2009-01-29 Chris Allegretta <chrisa@asty.org>
	* nano.c (main): Add support for nano acting like a pager when invoked with - as first

	* doc/syntax/gentoo.nanorc: Updates from David and Mike Frysinger.

2009-01-25 Chris Allegretta <chrisa@asty.org>
	* files.c (open_file), nanorc.c (parse_include): Don't get_full_path on 
	  included rc files, due to it potentially impacting the ability
	  to read files in nano's cwd().  Fixes Savnanah bug #25297 reported by Mike 
	  Frysinger)

2009-01-24 Chris Allegretta <chrisa@asty.org>
	* First pass at some caching of caching color info.  Right now it's only for
	  multi-line regexes but this may not be enough to increase performance.
	* Add interruptability to search functions.  New functions enable_nodelay and
	  disable_nodelay and changes to the routines to handle checking for pending
	  searches.  Fixes Savnnah bug 24946: Need interrrupt for search.

2009-01-19 Chris Allegretta <chrisa@asty.org>
	* Change function definitions to shorts instead of (void *)s.  New mapping function
          iso_me_harder_funcmap().  Fixes compilation complaints with -pedantic, 
	  reported by Eitan Adler <eitanadlerlist@gmail.com>.

2008-10-20 Chris Allegretta <chrisa@asty.org>

2008-08-29 Chris Allegretta <chrisa@asty.org>
	* configure.ac, color.c, rcfile.c, utils.c: 1st attempt at supporting systems which don't support

          may be NULL

	has_blank_mbchars): Simplify by using for loops instead of while
	loops where possible, to match the single-byte versions of these
	functions.
	* search.c (do_replace_loop): Fix problem where replacing e.g.
	single-byte characters with multibyte ones could result in
	openfile->totsize's being miscalculated.

	* chars.c (nstrcasestr, mbstrcasestr, revstrstr, revstrcasestr,
	mbrevstrcasestr): Return char* instead of const char*.

2007-07-02  David Lawrence Ramsey  <pooka109@gmail.com>

	* chars.c (nstrcasestr, mbstrcasestr, revstrstr, revstrcasestr,
	mbrevstrcasestr): For efficiency, return haystack/rev_start
	immediately if needle is blank.

2007-07-01  David Lawrence Ramsey  <pooka109@gmail.com>

	* chars.c (nstrncasecmp, mbstrncasecmp): For efficiency, return
	zero immediately if s1 and s2 point to the same string.

2007-06-30  David Lawrence Ramsey  <pooka109@gmail.com>

	* prompt.c (do_yesno_prompt): Remove redundant check for
	NO_HELP's being FALSE.

2007-06-28  David Lawrence Ramsey  <pooka109@gmail.com>

	* browser.c (do_browser), nano.c (do_mouse), prompt.c
	(do_statusbar_mouse, do_yesno_prompt): Further simplify
	processing of mouse events by consolidating if clauses.
	* winio.c (do_mouseinput): Return unconditionally if we get a
	mouse event that we don't deal with, instead of inside an else
	clause.

2007-05-29  David Lawrence Ramsey  <pooka109@gmail.com>

	* winio.c (do_mouseinput): Deal with clicks of the first mouse
	button again.  Oddly, ncurses built without --enable-ext-mouse
	needs this, but ncurses built with --enable-ext-mouse doesn't.

2007-05-25  David Lawrence Ramsey  <pooka109@gmail.com>

	* configure.ac, nano.c (main): Replace the current hackish check
	for a UTF-8 locale with a proper call to nl_langinfo().
	* winio.c (get_key_buffer): Fix inaccurate comments.

2007-05-22  David Lawrence Ramsey  <pooka109@gmail.com>

	* browser.c (do_browser), nano.c (do_mouse), prompt.c
	(do_statusbar_mouse, do_yesno_prompt), winio.c (do_mouseinput):
	Simplify processing of mouse events.  Instead of calling
	wenclose() to get the window a mouse event took place in and
	manually adjusting the returned coordinates to be relative to
	that window the mouse event took place in, call wmouse_trafo(),
	which does both.

2007-05-20  David Lawrence Ramsey  <pooka109@gmail.com>

	* browser.c (do_browser), nano.c (do_mouse), prompt.c
	(do_statusbar_mouse, do_yesno_prompt), winio.c (do_mouseinput):
	Fix processing of mouse events so that those we don't handle are
	ignored instead of being erroneously passed through.
	* winio.c (do_mouseinput): Simplify handling of mouse events
	involving the first mouse button by only dealing with releases.
	* winio.c (do_mouseinput): Improve mouse wheel support to only
	move the cursor if we're in the edit window or on the statusbar.

2007-05-15  David Lawrence Ramsey  <pooka109@gmail.com>

	* winio.c (do_mouseinput): Add mouse wheel support, per Helmut
	Jarausch's suggestion.  Now, if mouse support is enabled, and
	nano is using a version of ncurses compiled with the
	--enable-ext-mouse option, rolling the mouse wheel up or down
	will move the cursor three lines up or down.

2007-04-23  David Lawrence Ramsey  <pooka109@gmail.com>

	* TODO: Add entries for fixing limitations with pasting text and
	handling bad/incomplete UTF-8 sequences.

2007-04-22  David Lawrence Ramsey  <pooka109@gmail.com>

	* text.c (backup_lines): Avoid a segfault when the mark begins
	and ends on the line after the last line of the paragraph.

2007-04-21  David Lawrence Ramsey  <pooka109@gmail.com>

	* files.c (do_writeout): If we're in restricted mode, we're not
	allowed to write selections to files, so don't display the
	"Write Selection to File" prompt.
	* files.c (do_writeout): Simplify.

2007-04-19  David Lawrence Ramsey  <pooka109@gmail.com>

	* files.c (tail): Remove unneeded if statement.

2007-04-18  John M. Gabriele  <jmg3000@gmail.com>

	* doc/faq.html: Add a new section 4.14 (with minor tweaks by
	David Lawrence Ramsey) to explain how autoindent affects pasted
	text.

2007-04-18  David Lawrence Ramsey  <pooka109@gmail.com>

	* files.c (open_file): Open files using their full paths
	whenever possible, so that ~user/file.txt and "~user/file.txt"
	are treated the same way if ~user is a user's home directory.
	* files.c (real_dir_from_tilde): Simplify.
	* files.c (do_writeout): Properly display the warning in all
	cases if we try to save (a) an existing file under a different
	name, or (b) a file with no name under an existing file's name.
	* files.c (do_writeout): Rename variable different_name to
	do_warning, for clarity.
	* rcfile.c (parse_include): Open files using their full paths
	whenever possible, so that ~user/file.txt and "~user/file.txt"
	are treated the same way if ~user is a user's home directory.
	* rcfile.c (parse_include): Properly check for the included
	file's being a directory, a character file, or a block file.
	* rcfile.c (parse_include): For consistency, display the
	filename as the user entered it if we can't read the specified
	file.
	* winio.c (parse_kbinput): Interpret Cancel and Shift-Cancel.
	* winio.c (get_escape_seq_kbinput): Add missing comments.

2007-04-17  David Lawrence Ramsey  <pooka109@gmail.com>

	* files.c (real_dir_from_tilde): Fix long-standing problem,
	found by Justin Fletcher, where directory names that began with
	"~", but that weren't users' home directories, could be
	erroneously treated as users' home directories (e.g. "~d/" would
	be treated as "~daemon/").
	* files.c (input_tab): Don't bother checking if num_matches is
	less than zero, as it's a size_t and hence unsigned.

2007-04-16  David Lawrence Ramsey  <pooka109@gmail.com>

	* files.c (real_dir_from_tilde): Fix segfault, found by Justin
	Fletcher, when dealing with directory names that begin with "~",
	but that aren't users' home directories.

2007-04-11  Mike Frysinger  <vapier@gentoo.org>

	* doc/syntax/asm.nanorc, doc/syntax/c.nanorc,
	doc/syntax/sh.nanorc: Copy the regex that highlights trailing
	whitespace (with minor tweaks by David Lawrence Ramsey) from
	doc/syntax/java.nanorc to these files, as it's also useful in
	them.

2007-04-04  David Lawrence Ramsey  <pooka109@gmail.com>

	* AUTHORS, faq.html: Update email address.
	* winio.c (get_escape_seq_kbinput): Add escape sequences for
	Terminal.

2007-02-01  Benno Schulenberg  <bensberg@justemail.net>

	* global.c (shortcut_init): Reword the movement shortcut
	descriptions so that they use "Go to" instead of "Move to",
	since not all of them move the cursor in the same way.
	* global.c (shortcut_init): Reword the paragraph movement
	shortcut descriptions to more accurately describe how they work.
	* nano.c (usage): Reword the description of the -S/--smooth
	command line option in order to differentiate it from the
	associated toggle description.

2007-01-29  David Lawrence Ramsey  <pooka109@cox.net>

	* ChangeLog: Rework the 2.1 branch's changelog to be more
	readable, per Jordi Mallach's suggestion.
	* ChangeLog.pre-2.1: Move the 2.0 branch's changelog here, per
	Jordi Mallach's suggestion.
	* Makefile.am: Add ChangeLog.pre-2.1 to EXTRA_DIST.
	* src/help.c (help_init): Add a missing space to the "Execute
	Command" help text.
