	* files.c (real_dir_from_tilde): Fix long-standing problem,
	found by Justin Fletcher, where directory names that began with
	"~", but that weren't users' home directories, could be
	erroneously treated as users' home directories (e.g. "~d/" would
	be treated as "~daemon/").
	* files.c (input_tab): Don't bother checking if num_matches is
	less than zero, as it's a size_t and hence unsigned.

	* files.c (real_dir_from_tilde): Fix segfault, found by Justin

	* doc/syntax/asm.nanorc, doc/syntax/c.nanorc,
	doc/syntax/sh.nanorc: Copy the regex that highlights trailing
	whitespace (with minor tweaks by David Lawrence Ramsey) from
	doc/syntax/java.nanorc to these files, as it's also useful in
	them.

	* global.c (shortcut_init): Reword the movement shortcut
	descriptions so that they use "Go to" instead of "Move to",
	since not all of them move the cursor in the same way.
	* global.c (shortcut_init): Reword the paragraph movement
	shortcut descriptions to more accurately describe how they work.
	* nano.c (usage): Reword the description of the -S/--smooth
	command line option in order to differentiate it from the
	associated toggle description.

	readable, per Jordi Mallach's suggestion.
	* ChangeLog.pre-2.1: Move the 2.0 branch's changelog here, per
	Jordi Mallach's suggestion.
	* Makefile.am: Add ChangeLog.pre-2.1 to EXTRA_DIST.
	* src/help.c (help_init): Add a missing space to the "Execute
	Command" help text.
