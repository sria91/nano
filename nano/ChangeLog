	* global.c (shortcut_init): Reword the movement shortcut
	descriptions so that they use "Go to" instead of "Move to",
	since not all of them move the cursor in the same way.
	* global.c (shortcut_init): Reword the paragraph movement
	shortcut descriptions to more accurately describe how they work.
